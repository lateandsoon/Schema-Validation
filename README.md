# Schema-Validation
This tool will compare the schema of a csv with the header of a csv to identify any issues.

Load the schema into the schema.csv file, and the file content you wish to validate in the file.csv.

Once complete double click the csvValidate.exe and it will run the validation.

If any issues are found the columns with issues will be displayed.
